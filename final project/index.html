    <h2>Stroke Predictor analysis</h2>
    <p>Stroke is a serious medical condition that occurs when blood flow to the brain is disrupted, leading to brain cell damage. It can have devastating consequences, affecting both individuals and society as a whole. 
      <br> 
      <br>Every year, more than 795,000 people in the United States experience a stroke. Approximately 610,000 of these cases are first or new strokes, while around 185,000 are recurrent strokes (in people who have previously had a stroke). Stroke is a leading cause of serious long-term disability. It significantly reduces mobility in more than half of stroke survivors aged 65 and older. Sadly, someone in the US dies from a stroke approximately every 3 minutes and 14 seconds. Stroke-related costs in the US totaled nearly $56.5 billion between 2018 and 2019. These costs include healthcare services, stroke medications, and lost workdays. 
      <br> 
      <br>Therefore, Stroke prevention, awareness, and rapid response are critical. By understanding the impact of stroke, we can take proactive steps to reduce its occurrence and improve outcomes for affected individuals. <br>
